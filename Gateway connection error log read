📍 3. Key Log Sections to Review
GatewayService Logs (Gateway*.txt)

Look for Connection errors such as:

System.Net.Sockets.SocketException → Network blocked (firewall/proxy issue)

System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException → TLS/SSL handshake failure

The gateway is unreachable → Gateway cannot reach Power BI Service

Query Execution Logs (QueryStart*.json / QueryEnd*.json)

Open in Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code for readability.

Search for:

"duration" → Shows query execution time

"exception" → If query failed, contains exact exception

"datasource" → Confirms which source was being queried (SQL, Oracle, etc.)


📍 5. Validate Gateway Connectivity

Test in Gateway UI → Data Source Settings → "Test Connection"

Run Telnet/PS test from gateway server:

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName pbiprodwus.centralus.data.microsoft.com -Port 443


This ensures the gateway can reach Power BI cloud endpoints.

📍 6. Common Fixes After Reading Logs

Auth failures → Fix credentials in Manage Gateway → Data Sources.

Firewall blocks → Ensure outbound TCP 443 is open to Power BI service endpoints.

TLS issues → Update .NET Framework and enable TLS 1.2.

Resource exhaustion → Monitor CPU/RAM usage on the gateway server, consider scaling out.
